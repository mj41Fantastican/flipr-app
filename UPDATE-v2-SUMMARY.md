## 🎮 MAJOR GAME MECHANIC CHANGES

### 1. ✅ "Call It" System - User Guesses First!
**NEW**: Before each flip, user must call HEADS or TAILS

**How it works:**
- User clicks "Start Free Session"
- Two big buttons appear: **HEADS** and **TAILS**
- User clicks their guess
- Coin flips for 1.8 seconds
- Result shows if they were right or wrong

**Win vs Loss:**
- ✅ **Guessed correctly** = Win (streak resets, no big deal)
- ❌ **Guessed wrong** = Loss (adds to streak, gets roasted!)

### 2. ✅ Payment Only on MINT (Free to Play!)
**CHANGED**: No more entry fees!

**Old way:**
- Pay $0.41 or $0.69 to start session ❌

**New way:**
- Start session = **FREE** ✅
- Flip coins = **FREE** ✅
- Mint NFT = **Pay $0.41 (Classic) or $0.69 (Degen)** 💰

**Why this is HUGE:**
- Lower barrier to entry
- Users can play forever for free
- Only pay when they want to immortalize their shame
- More plays = more engagement = more eventual mints

### 3. ✅ Streak Starts at 2 Losses
**NEW**: Losing streak only counts when 2+ consecutive wrong guesses

**How it works:**
- First wrong guess: Shows "Oops! One loss down..."
- Second wrong guess: **STREAK BEGINS** 🔥 + Roast appears!
- Third+ wrong guess: Streak continues, more savage roasts!
- One correct guess: **Streak resets** to 0
