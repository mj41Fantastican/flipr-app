# 🤫 FLIPR SECRET MECHANICS - HIDDEN FEATURES!

## 🎭 WHAT'S SECRET NOW

All the fun mechanics are still there, but now they're **completely hidden** from users! This makes discovering them way more fun.

## 🕵️ SECRET #1: Degen Mode Heads Bias (6.9%)

### What It Does:
In Degenerate mode, heads is favored by 6.9%
- **Classic Mode**: 50% heads, 50% tails (fair)
- **Degen Mode**: 56.9% heads, 43.1% tails (biased)

### Why It's Hidden:
Users will notice over time but won't know for sure. Creates conspiracy theories and discussion!

### The Funny Explanation (In Code Only):
```javascript
// WHY? Because Busty Betty weighs more in the chest area than the back end,
// throwing off the coin's physical properties. It's just physics, bro. 🍑
```

### Where It Lives:
- Code: `components/FliprGame.tsx` line ~120
- UI: **NO MENTION ANYWHERE** ✅
- Users have to discover it themselves!

### What Users Will Say:
- "Dude, I swear heads comes up more in degen mode!"
- "Is it just me or is this rigged?"
- "Always call tails in degen mode!"
- Perfect organic discussion! 🔥

## 🎲 SECRET #2: Edge Landing System (69/41 Pattern)

### What It Does:
Coin can land on its EDGE (standing vertically) = automatic loss
- Happens at flip: 69, 110, 179, 220, 289, 330...
- Pattern: 69, then +41, then +69, then +41... forever

### Why It's Hidden:
Pure chaos! Users think they're going crazy when it happens.

### The Funny Explanation (In Code Only):
```javascript
// Secret mechanic: Coin lands on edge at flip 69, then 110, then 179, then 220...
// Pattern alternates between +69 and +41. Why? Because it's funny and breaks up
// the monotony of 50/50. Users will think they're going crazy. Perfect. 🎲
```

### Where It Lives:
- Code: `components/FliprGame.tsx` edge landing logic
- UI: **NO COUNTDOWN, NO WARNINGS** ✅
- Just happens randomly to users!

### What Happens:
- Coin displays as thin vertical line (standing on edge)
- Pink glow effect
- Text: "EDGE LANDING! Automatic loss! 🎲"
- Counts as wrong guess (adds to streak)
- No explanation given!

### What Users Will Say:
- "WTF the coin just landed on its side?!"
- "Has anyone else seen the edge landing?"
- "I swear this happened at flip 69... coincidence?"
- Screenshot gold! 📸
